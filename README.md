# Task
1. Implement a function with two arguments, both are lists of possibly different length. The function must return a dictionary (dict for Python or object for JS) with keys from the first list and corresponding values from the second. If a key lacks value, the resulting dictionary must contain None for that key (or null for JavaScript). Redundant values must be ignored. Keys are guaranteed to be unique.  

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 3 and 4, the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci-like sequence will be: 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, 123, 199, ... . By considering the terms in this sequence whose values do not exceed seven million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.  

3. Create an echo server that receives string messages and sends them back in the upper case. Server must support many simultaneous connections.  

4. Create a Docker Compose configuration with an echo server from the task 3. Echo service must be accessible from the outside.
